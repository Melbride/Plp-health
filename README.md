# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Based on Symptoms

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on observable symptoms. It's a quick and symptom-driven tool designed for early detection support and educational use.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **Diabetes_Symptoms_(1).ipynb** — The Jupyter Notebook containing all data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is a symptom-based diabetes dataset, including the following features:

- Polyuria
- Polydipsia
- Sudden weight loss
- Weakness
- Polyphagia
- Genital thrush
- Visual blurring
- Itching
- Irritability
- Delayed healing
- Partial paresis
- Muscle stiffness
- Alopecia
- Obesity

The target variable is:  
✅ **Diabetes** — Whether the individual has diabetes or not.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn / Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Model and Performance

The project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the presence of diabetes.

Key evaluation metrics used:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-symptoms-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-symptoms-prediction
